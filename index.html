        <p class="lead mb-4">My name is Jara Dioum. I'm from the Bay Area, and I went to Clayton valley Charter High School. I participated in many clubs and sports. My main activities were BSU and track and field. I ran track for four years, and I high jumped for the most part. I won the league meet as a freshman. For Bsu, I also participated for four years. I didn't have any leadership positions until senior year though. For senior year, I was in charge of coordinating events, and relaying messages to social media.I graduated with a 3.9 cumulative Gpa. I currerntly attend the Universtiy of California Riverside. As of now, I am majoring in Media and Cultural Studies. Soon, I plan on switching to either pre business or English.Riverside has definitley been an adjustment, but I'm excited for what's to come. <br><br>

        As of now, I have not been in the work force. Some family issues prevented me from attaining a job. Now that I'm on my own in college, I'm ready to start my proffesional journey. Even though I din't have a paying job, I still found ways to get involved. In high school, I volunteered a good amount. My first volunteer oppurtunity was at the recycling club at school. On weekends, we would go to certain areas and clean up the surrounding trash. We would make sure that it got disposed of directly. For example, we would make sure the recycle goes into the recycling bin and the trash goes into the trash bin. I also volunteered at track meets a lot. I was injured for a majority of my junior and senior track season, but I didn't let that stop me from getting involved with the team. Whenever I could't run or jump, I would still attend track meets anf help out. I would make sure that events ran smoothly. I would also help out at any stations they needed help at. For example, I would help sell food and tickets. Even though I have no real professional experience, I was able to attain skills that will help me as soon as I decide to enter the work force.<br><br>

        There are many career choices out there, and right now, I'm not completely sure as to which field I want to go into. While I'm here at the University of California Riverside, I plan to take advantage of my resources in order to find the field that best suites me. I consider myself a very strong writter, so I'm interested in going into a field that has a lot of writting. Within that dpeartment, I'm interested in journalism, or writting/ marketing for a big company. Stem and tech are not my strongest subjects, but I would still like to break into the field with my other abilities. I also really like interacting with people. I consider myself a big people person. I really like to talk to people and help them resolve any of the conflicts that they're involved in. I really like doing this because seeing other people happy makes me extremely happy. I like feeling like I helped make someone's day a lot better. Because of this interest, I am also looking at getting into psychology. It would be cool to become a therapist or a counselor. They've always helped me a lot, so I feel like I want to return the favor. Even though I don't know exactly what I want to do right now proffessionaly, the University of California Riverside will definitley provide me with the resources and experience to help me pick what career field is best suited for me.
